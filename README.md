# Class-Collab-Challenge-1
Our first assignment to practice using our collaboration tools: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation


Step 1. Each student must create a new branch to be able to push their changes. 
Step 2. Each group member will add their name to the file 'ClassRoster.txt' in this format: 'real name - githubusername' 
Step 3. Each student will then create a pull request to merge their branch into the main repo branch. 

The GroupMembers.txt file will become a combined class roster to be used by Ms Ramirez to grade your future github assignments. 
Students may also complete this assignment completely via the browser if github desktop was not available for your device.
